_One day, while cleaning the server trays, a kind young soul was thrust into a strange fate.. Their soul now lives within the server and needs your help to be set free..._

GIM LLC is an escape room inspired website where players work together to find clues to free the ghost! 

Server side built using node.js, express, and socket.io for multiplayer interactivity. 

The repository for the front end can be found [here](https://github.com/GIM-LLC/GIM-server).
